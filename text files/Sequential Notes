#SEQUENTIAL SEARCH-------------------------------------------------------------------
#sequential search: to search for an item by comparing it to all items found within a collection (list)
#        Searchnig Steps:
#        1. Set Up & Gaining Search Item from user
#        2. Perform the searching algorithm
#        3. Filter and display results: tell user if the item is found or not; if found, display required data


'''
A simple overview of sequential search:

#step 1: set up and gain search
found = -1 #we are using -1 because it is not a valid index location (technically); you could also use found = "x"

search = input("What are you searching for? ")

#step 2: perform the searching algorithm
for i in range(0, len(listYouAreSearchingThrough)):

    if search == listYouAreSearchingThrough[i]: 
        found = i #found drops its original value (-1 or "x") and is replaced with the current index location
        #since this occurs in the if statement, it will only happen IF what we are looking for matches one of the values on the list we are searching through

#step 3: check and display your results
if found != -1: #(or "x" if that was your initial value
    #found has changed, meaning at some point it checked into the if statement within our searching for loop
    
    print(f"Your search for {search} has been FOUND!")
    #display relevant data/results here using 'found' as your index representer 
    print(f"{listYouAreSearchingThrough[found]}")
    
else:
    #found is still its initial value, meaning we did not find the data the user was looking for
    #tell the user their search came up empty
    print(f"Your search for {search} has NOT BEEN FOUND!")
